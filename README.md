## 📚 Course Overview

This course explores the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence, and space exploration. Students gain hands-on experience with:

- **Autonomous Navigation & Control**: Path planning, trajectory optimization, and controller tuning
- **Optimal Control Theory**: LQR controllers and reinforcement learning for robotic systems
- **Computer Vision & Perception**: Feature detection, SLAM, and 3D reconstruction
- **Drone Operations**: PX4 autopilot, offboard control, and mission planning
- **ROS2 Development**: Building and deploying robotic systems using modern software frameworks

All assignments use industry-standard tools including ROS2, Gazebo simulation, PX4 autopilot, and real-time visualization with RViz.

## 🎯 Assignments

### Assignment 1: First-Order Boustrophedon Navigator
**Topics:** PD Control, Trajectory Tracking, Coverage Path Planning

<img width="488" height="529" alt="Boustrophedon Pattern" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/100a2f14-7dde-4dd2-b730-a1d65d6cc49c" />

Students tune a PD controller to execute precise lawnmower survey patterns (boustrophedon) using the ROS2 Turtlesim. This fundamental pattern is used in space exploration, precision agriculture, and search-and-rescue operations.

**Key Skills:**
- PD controller parameter tuning
- Cross-track error minimization
- Real-time performance visualization with RQT
- Trajectory optimization

### Assignment 2: Cart-Pole Optimal Control
**Topics:** LQR Control, System Dynamics, Reinforcement Learning

Students analyze and tune an LQR controller for an inverted pendulum (cart-pole) system subject to earthquake disturbances. This assignment develops skills critical for controlling systems under dynamic perturbations, applicable to lunar landers and orbital debris removal robots.

**Key Skills:**
- LQR controller analysis and tuning
- Q and R matrix optimization
- Disturbance rejection
- Optional: Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation for extra credit

### Assignment 3: Rocky Times Challenge - Search, Map, & Analyze
**Topics:** Autonomous Drones, Computer Vision, SLAM, PX4 Control

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e3d9610-a63a-4949-88a1-a14166a9ed50" alt="Terrain Mapping Challenge" width="500"/>

Students develop an autonomous drone system to search for, map, and analyze cylindrical rock formations in unknown terrain. The drone must estimate dimensions, plan efficient search patterns, and land precisely on the target—simulating geological exploration missions.

**Key Skills:**
- PX4 offboard control
- Real-time feature detection and tracking
- 3D reconstruction with RTAB-Map
- Energy-efficient path planning
- Precision landing
